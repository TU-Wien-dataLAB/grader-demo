# Grader Service Demo Environment

In this JupyterLab environment, you can try out the [Grader Service](https://github.com/TU-Wien-dataLAB/Grader-Service) without any setup or configuration on your part. 
You can create assignments, see how students can solve and submit them, and see how auto-grading and manual-grading work (for your own submissions).

To get started check out the [Official Documentation](https://grader-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (especially the [Instructor Guide](https://grader-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructor_guide.html#) and [Student Guide](https://grader-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/student_guide.html))!
It will teach you the basics and you can try it out right here!

If you don't want to create your own example assignment, we created a `Prime_Example.ipynb` file for you.
Just copy and paste it into your assignment's source folder!
